1. How does Java achieve runtime polymorphism, and why is method overriding a key aspect of it?
Ans:
	Java achieves runtime polymorphism through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific 
	implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. 
	The key to runtime polymorphism is that method calls are resolved at runtime rather than at compile time.  
	
	Method Overriding: A subclass overrides a method from its superclass, providing a new implementation.
	Upcasting (Reference Type Behavior): A superclass reference variable can hold an object of the subclass.
	Dynamic Method Dispatch: At runtime, Java determines which overridden method to call based on the actual object type, not the reference type.
Example:

	class Parent 
	{
    		void show() 
		{
        		System.out.println("Parent's show method");
   		}
	}

	class Child extends Parent 
	{
    		void show() 
		{
        		System.out.println("Child's show method");
    		}
	}

	public class TestPolymorphism 
	{
    		public static void main(String[] args) 
		{
        		Parent obj = new Child(); // Upcasting
        		obj.show(); // Calls Child's show method at runtime
    		}
	}
	Key Aspect:
	 1. Enables Dynamic Behavior: Allows Java to choose the correct method implementation at runtime.
	 2. Supports Loose Coupling: Enables code flexibility by allowing behavior to be modified in subclasses without changing the superclass.
	 3. Facilitates Object-Oriented Design: Helps in achieving abstraction and encapsulation, key principles of OOP.
	 4. Used in Frameworks and APIs: Many Java frameworks (Spring, Hibernate) and APIs (JDBC, Servlets) rely on method overriding for extensibility


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. Explain the concept of multiple inheritance. Why is it not supported in Java, and how can it be achieved indirectly?

Ans:	
	Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming where a class can inherit from more than one superclass. 
	This means the child class inherits properties and behaviors from multiple parent classes.

	Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid the diamond problem and maintain simplicity.

	Example:
	
	class A 
	{
    		void show() { System.out.println("A's method"); }
	}

	class B extends A 
	{
    		void show() { System.out.println("B's method"); }
	}

	class C extends A 
	{
    		void show() { System.out.println("C's method"); }
	}

	class D extends B, C { } // Not allowed in Java


	If class D inherited from both B and C, and both B and C override show(), which version should D inherit?
	This ambiguity is called the diamond problem.

	Although Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes, it allows multiple inheritance using interfaces.
	Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces, because interfaces only define method signatures (without implementation), 
	avoiding the diamond problem.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using composition over inheritance in OOP design?  
Ans:
Advantages:
	1. Greater Flexibility
	-Composition allows changing behavior at runtime by swapping components, whereas inheritance is fixed at compile time.
	Example: A Car can have different types of Engine (Petrol, Diesel, Electric) without modifying the Car class.

	2. Avoids Inheritance Hierarchy Complexity
	-Deep inheritance trees can become rigid and difficult to maintain.
	-Composition keeps classes modular and reusable without creating tightly coupled hierarchies.

	3. Prevents Fragile Base Class Problem
	-Inheritance makes subclasses dependent on the base class, meaning a small change in the base class might break subclasses.
	-Composition allows replacing parts without affecting other components.
	
	4. Encourages Encapsulation
	-With composition, objects interact via well-defined interfaces rather than exposing internal details.
	-Inheritance exposes parent class implementation details, making it harder to modify code without side effects.
	
	5. Supports Better Code Reusability
	-With composition, functionality is encapsulated in smaller, independent classes that can be reused across different parts of an application.

Disadvantages:
	1. More Boilerplate Code
	-Composition requires explicit delegation, leading to more method calls and wrapper methods compared to simple inheritance
	
	2. More Object References
	-Composition increases memory usage as multiple objects are created and referenced.
	-In contrast, inheritance keeps everything within a single object instance.
	
	3. Harder to Override Behavior
	-Inheritance allows method overriding, but composition requires explicit delegation or implementing interfaces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. How does the "Liskov Substitution Principle" relate to inheritance in OOP? Provide an example
Ans:
	The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). 
	It states:
	"Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program."
	In simpler terms, a subclass should be a true substitute for its superclass without breaking functionality.

	Relates to inheritance:
	Ensures correct use of polymorphism: A subclass should extend a superclass without changing expected behavior.
	Prevents incorrect subclassing: If a subclass removes functionality or violates expected behavior, it breaks LSP.
	Encourages well-structured hierarchies: Avoids situations where a subclass modifies or ignores behavior in a way that contradicts the base class.

Example:
	class Rectangle 
	{
    		protected int width, height;

    		public void setWidth(int width) { this.width = width; }
    		public void setHeight(int height) { this.height = height; }

    		public int getArea() { return width * height; }
	}

	class Square extends Rectangle 
	{
    		public void setWidth(int width) 
		{
        		this.width = this.height = width;  // Forces height = width
    		}

    		public void setHeight(int height) 
		{
        		this.width = this.height = height;  // Forces width = height
    		}
	}

	public class TestLSP 
	{
    		public static void main(String[] args) 
		{
        		Rectangle rect = new Square();  

        		rect.setWidth(10);
		        rect.setHeight(5);

        		System.out.println("Expected Area: 10 * 5 = 50");
        		System.out.println("Actual Area: " + rect.getArea()); // Incorrect result!
    		}
	}

Output:
Expected Area: 10 * 5 = 50
Actual Area: 25  // Wrong output!

	A Square forces both width and height to be the same, breaking the expected behavior of a Rectangle.
	If a function relies on Rectangle behavior (e.g., setting independent width and height), the Square subclass breaks this assumption.

	Instead of forcing a Square to be a Rectangle, we can use composition

	interface Shape 
	{
    		int getArea();
	}

	class Rectangle implements Shape 
	{
    		protected int width, height;
		
		public Rectangle(int width, int height) 
		{
        		this.width = width;
        		this.height = height;
    		}

    		public int getArea() { return width * height; }
	}

	class Square implements Shape 
	{
    		private int side;

    		public Square(int side) { this.side = side; }

    		public int getArea() { return side * side; }
	}

	Now, both Rectangle and Square follow LSP, since they don't force one behavior onto the other.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. What is method hiding in Java, and how is it different from method overriding? 
Ans:
	When a static method in a subclass has the same signature as a static method in the superclass, it hides the superclass method.
	Method hiding follows compile-time binding, meaning the method call is resolved based on the reference type.

Example:
	class Parent 
	{
    		static void show() 
		{
        		System.out.println("Parent's show method");
    		}
	}

	class Child extends Parent 
	{
    		static void show() 
		{ 
		        System.out.println("Child's show method");
    		}
	}

	public class Test 
	{
    		public static void main(String[] args) 
		{
        		Parent obj = new Child(); // Upcasting
        		obj.show();  // Calls Parent's show() because method hiding follows reference type
    		}
	}

	Method hiding follows compile-time binding (early binding).
	The method call is resolved based on the reference type (Parent), not the object type (Child).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. How do inner classes work in Java? What are the different types of inner classes, and when should they be used?  
Ans:
	An inner class is a class defined inside another class in Java. 
	Inner classes help logically group related classes, improve encapsulation, and provide better organization.

	1. Member Inner Class
	-A member inner class is a non-static class defined inside another class. 
	-It has access to all members of the outer class, including private members.
	When to use:
	-When an inner class logically belongs to an outer class and requires access to private members.
	-Example: Encapsulating related functionality like an engine inside a car
	
	2. Static Nested Class
	-A static nested class is similar to a regular class but is declared static inside another class.
	-It does not have access to instance members of the outer class.
	When to use:
	-When the inner class does not need access to the outer classâ€™s instance members.

	3. Local Inner Class
	-A local inner class is defined inside a method and is only accessible within that method.
	When to use:
	-When an inner class is needed only for a specific method.

	4. Anonymous Inner Class
	-An anonymous inner class is a class without a name, typically used for one-time use.
	When to use:
	-When you need a one-time subclass implementation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Explain the purpose of the "super" and "this" keywords in Java. How do they help in constructor chaining? 
Ans:
	The super and this keywords are used to refer to superclass and current class members, respectively. 
	They are particularly useful for constructor chaining, which helps avoid code duplication and improves maintainability.

	Constructor chaining allows one constructor to call another constructor in the same class (this()) or a 
	superclass constructor (super()), avoiding redundant code.
	
	1. super keyword: Constructor Chaining Across Classes.
	class Animal 
	{
    		Animal() 
		{
        		System.out.println("Animal Constructor");
    		}
	}

	class Dog extends Animal 
	{
    		Dog() 
		{
        		super();  
        		System.out.println("Dog Constructor");
    		}
	}

	public class Test 
	{
    		public static void main(String[] args) 
		{
        		Dog d = new Dog();  
    		}
	}

	
	2. this keyword: Constructor Chaining in the Same Class

	class Person 
	{
    		String name;
    		int age;

    		Person() 
		{
        		this("Unknown", 18);  // Calls the second constructor
    		}

    		Person(String name, int age) 
		{
        		this.name = name;
        		this.age = age;
        		System.out.println("Person Created: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
    		}
	}

	public class Test 
	{
    		public static void main(String[] args) 
		{
        		Person p1 = new Person();  // Calls default constructor, which calls another constructor
    		}
	}

	this("Unknown", 18); calls another constructor in the same class to reuse code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. What is covariance and contravariance in Java with respect to method return types? 
Ans:
	In Java, covariance and contravariance define how types behave when overriding methods in a subclass.
	1. Covariant Return Types (Allowed in Java)
	-Covariant return type means that an overridden method in a subclass can return a subtype of the return type declared in the superclass.

Example:
	class Parent 
	{
    		Parent get() 
		{ 
        		return this;
    		}
	}

	class Child extends Parent 
	{
    		Child get() 
		{      
		    return this;
    		}
	}

	public class Test 
	{
    		public static void main(String[] args) 
		{
        		Child c = new Child();
        		System.out.println(c.get().getClass().getName());
    		}
	}

	 Here, Child.get() returns Child instead of Parent, demonstrating covariant return types.

	2. Contravariance (Not Allowed in Java Return Types)
	-In Java, return types cannot be contravariant. 
	-This means an overridden method in a subclass cannot return a supertype of the return type declared in the superclass.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. How does object cloning work in Java? What are the different ways to achieve cloning, and how do deep and shallow copies differ?  
Ans:
	Object cloning is the process of creating an exact copy of an object in memory. 
	Java provides different ways to achieve cloning, mainly using shallow copy and deep copy.
  
	1. Using Cloneable Interface and Object.clone() (Shallow Copy)
	-Java provides a built-in method for cloning objects via the Cloneable interface and the clone() method.

	2. Deep Copy (Manually Copying Objects)
	-A deep copy ensures that cloned objects have completely new copies of mutable fields instead of referencing the original fields.

	3. Using Copy Constructors (Alternative to clone())
	-Instead of using Cloneable, we can create a copy constructor that manually copies object fields.
.  
	4. Using Serialization for Deep Copy
	-Serialization can be used to create a deep copy by converting an object into bytes and reconstructing it
 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

10. What are marker interfaces in Java? How do they work, and can they be replaced by annotations?  
Ans:
	A marker interface is an interface that has no methods or fields and serves as a tagging mechanism to provide 
	metadata about a class at runtime.

	Marker interfaces do not define any behavior. Instead, they are used to signal to the JVM or other parts of the 
	program that a class has a special property.
	
	Example:
	Serializable:	Marks objects that can be converted to a byte stream (used in Serialization).
	Cloneable:	Allows objects to be cloned using the clone() method.
	Remote:		Used in Java RMI to indicate that an object can be accessed remotely.

	Yes, Annotations provide a better alternative to marker interfaces.
	Marker interfaces require instanceof checks, while annotations can be processed via reflection (@Retention(RUNTIME)).
	Annotations allow additional metadata, whereas marker interfaces are just "tags".
