Guess the output : 


Q1.


Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("x", 100);
map.put("y", 200);
map.put("x", 300);
System.out.println(map.get("x"));


Q2.


Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put(null, "first");
map.put("key", "value");
map.put(null, "second");
System.out.println(map);




Q3.


Map<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
map.put(3, "Three");
map.put(1, "One");
map.put(2, "Two");
System.out.println(map);


Q4.


Map<String, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
map.put("a", "apple");
map.put(null, "nothing");
System.out.println(map);



Q5.
Map<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
map.put(1, "One");
map.put(3, "Three");
map.put(2, "Two");
System.out.println(map.keySet());




Coding : 


1. You are given two text files, file1.txt and file2.txt, both of which contain a list of names.
  Your task is to find names that are common to both files and write them to a new file called 
  common_names.txt. 




2.


Longest Palindromic Substring
Input: `"babad"`
Output: `"bab"` (or `"aba"`)





3. CamelCase Pattern Matching


Input: arr[] = [ “WelcomeGeek”, “WelcomeToGeeksForGeeks”, “GeeksForGeeks” ], pattern = “WTG” 
Output: WelcomeToGeeksForGeeks 
Explanation: 
There is only one abbreviation for the given pattern i.e., WelcomeToGeeksForGeeks.


Input: arr[] = [ “Hi”, “Hello”, “HelloWorld”, “HiTech”, “HiGeek”, “HiTechWorld”, “HiTechCity”, “HiTechLab” ], pattern = “HA” 
Output: No match found 
Explanation: 
There is no such abbreviation for the given pattern.


Q4. Write a Java program to find the longest word in a text file.


5.  String Compression

Input: `"aaabbccc"`
Output: `"a3b2c3"`

Q6. Calculate the frequency of each word in the given string using HashMap.


Q7.


  *
  * 1 *
  * 1 2 1 *
  * 1 2 3 2 1 *
  * 1 2 1 *
  * 1 *
  *


Q8. Maximum number of characters between any two same character
Given a string containing lower and uppercase alphabets, the task is to find the maximum
number of characters between any two same characters in the string.
Example 1:
Input:
S = "socks"
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 characters between
the two occurrences of 's'.




Q9.Create a recursive function to check the given String is palindrome or not.




Q10. Roman to Integer
Input: `"IX"`
Output: `9`
